How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you when we were getting high ?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high ?


Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky


Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall,
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you when we were getting high ?


Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
